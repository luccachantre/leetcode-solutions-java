# leetcode-solutions-java
A collection of leetcode problems that I've solved or attempted (and later learned the solution)

## For my own reference
when making files and classes, name the file like 0020-ValidParentheses.java  
then you can name the class inside whatever as long as its not public (ex. 'class ValidParentheses {}')  
then once you made public static main and public static (the problem method) you run:  
javac 0020-ValidParentheses.java  
this makes an executable .class file with the name of the class, not the file, so then in this scenario you would run  
java ValidParentheses  

also apparently to do line breaks in readme you do two spaces at the end of a line of text,  
or do a line of space between lines

see?
